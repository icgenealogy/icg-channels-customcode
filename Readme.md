# icg-channels-customcode

Custom code needed to run some channel files.

The files in this repository were compiled from several [published models on the ModelDB website](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb).

## Usage

Ideally, you should clone the [icg-nrn-sim](https://github.com/icgenealogy/icg-nrn-sim) repository including this submodule.

Alternatively, clone this directory (e.g. to ``/tmp/icg-channels-customcode``) and link it into the cloned ``/tmp/icg-nrn-sim`` directory:
```bash
ln -s /tmp/icg-channels-customcode /tmp/icg-nrn-sim/icg-channels-customcode
```
